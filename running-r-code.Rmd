# Running R Code

## Navigating RStudio

Now you should have both R and RStudio downloaded and installed. When you open RStudio for the first time, this is what you should see:

![RStudio default startup view.](images/Rstudio_startup.png)

The version of R you just installed should appear in the main window, or console, here:

![Locating R Version in RStudio.](images/Rstudio_Rversion.png)

(If this message does not appear, go to *Tools*->*Global Options*, or *RStudio*->*Preferences* on Mac, and make sure that the "R version" box is set to the correct folder.)

Currently, the RStudio interface has three key regions, as highlighted below.

![Important regions in the RStudio interface.](images/Rstudio_startup_regions.png)

### Console

You can run code directly by typing your R code into the console pane. The console is mainly used for installing packages (more on that later), but can also be used for quick arithmetic. Try typing "2+2" into the console, then hit Enter.

``` {r console_math}
2+2
```

While the console is useful for short-and-sweet commands, you will mainly be using the Scripts window to run chunks of code (see 2.2 Script vs. Console).

### Environment

The environment window lists all variables, packages, and functions which you have run since opening RStudio. This window is particularly useful if you want to view your data in a format similar to an Excel spreadsheet directly from RStudio, which we will discuss in Section 3 of this book.


### Viewer

The Viewer window has a couple of useful tabs. We will mainly use it to export plots (more on that in later chapters), but you can also open code files from the "Files" tab without having to leave RStudio (expanded on in Section 3). 



### Customizing RStudio

As many of us spend an absurd amount of time staring at bright screens, some of you may be interested in setting your RStudio to Dark Mode. 

You can customize the appearance of your RStudio interface by clicking *Tools*->*Global Options*, or *RStudio*->*Preferences* on Mac, then click "Appearance" on the left. Select your preferred Editor Theme from the list.

  - Tearable tabs; again, kids don’t realize you can tear off a tab into a new window so you can see your data and code side-by-side (click and drag tab to tear off).

## Script vs. Console

- Where to run code in RStudio (script vs. console) 

## Coding building blocks

- Basic coding building blocks 
  - Variable assignment (howdy <- “Howdy world”) 
  - Creating vectors, matrices, lists, DFs
  - Importing packages
  - Calling functions

## Script formatting
- Brief style guide 
  - Packages loaded at the top. 
  - How to comment code (#I’m cold and there are wolves after me) 
  -Suggestion for variable names (good_name vs. thisNameWillWork_butIsAwfulToType); including forbidden names 
  -Script headers (i.e. # heading1, ## subheading); These are picked-up by RStudio and displayed in the Document Outline box allowing easy navigation of long scripts.
