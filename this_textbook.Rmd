This textbook encourages active learning. Don't merely read through the content---interact with it. Type out the code in your R environment and see the results firsthand. This hands-on approach will solidify your comprehension and enhance your practical skills. Observe how the code behaves, experiment with modifications, and observe how changes impact the outcomes. 

**2. Curiosity and Inquisitiveness**

When you encounter code you don't fully understand or want to know the underlying process, lean into your curiosity. Don't hesitate to ask "Why?" and explore concepts beyond the immediate scope. Seek to understand the "why" and "how" alongside the "what." 

**3. Resources and Further Explanation**
