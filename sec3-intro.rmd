# (PART\*) Section 3: Data Analysis Toolbox {-}

# Introduction

Toolbox for data analysis that will envetually cover stuff like:

- different visualizations used in CHM410/env chem w/ links to more useful websites
- statistics, but mostly just those needed for undergrad envb. chem. 
- better elaboration on linear regression modelling with descriptions with all of the fit parameters. 
- non-linear regression
- interactive plots (probably in the visualizations chapter above)
- how to lie w/ statistics and plots. Chapter explaining graphicacy and numeracy.
