# Preface {-}

Howdy, 

This is a a proof-of-concept for how a textbook can be written in R markdown, and published to the web. All of the web stuff is done automatically so we only need to focus on the content. 

I'd added some quick sections from documents I've written for previous courses to illustrate some of the possibilities.
