# Getting Started:

We will be using the Air Quality data as we've seen before. If you don't have the data, before diving into the exercises, follow the instructions below to download a dataset from the Exploring Air Quality Data website.

-   Visit the [Exploring Air Quality Data](https://uoft-chem.shinyapps.io/Air_Quality_App/) and go to `My Data` tab.
-   Enter your student number, and then download the CSV file.
-   Upload the file to your RStudio. 

Use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr`(`tidyverse`) package to import your Air Quality dataset, and assign the imported data to a variable named `data`.

```{r}
# Complete the code below and run the cell.

# Import data from CSV file using read_csv -- your code here
data <- read_csv("2018-07-01_60430_Toronto_ON.csv")
```


Before diving into the visualizations, you have an important task: calculating the Oxidant concentration, commonly known as Ox. Ox is typically calculated as the sum of the concentrations of two pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3). Here’s how you can approach this:

1. **Filter the Data for NO2 and O3:** Start by filtering your dataset to include only the measurements for the pollutants NO2 and O3.

2. **Group the Data:** Since we are interested in Ox levels over time and across different locations, you’ll need to group the data by `date.time`, `city`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.

3. **Summarise the Data:** Within each group, calculate the sum of the `concentration` to get the total Ox concentration. Remember to handle missing values appropriately.

4. **Create a New Dataset:** Finally, create a new dataset with this aggregated information. This dataset will be used in your upcoming visualization exercises.


```{r}
# Calculate Ox as the sum of NO2 and O3 concentrations
ox_data <-
```

Once you have successfully created the `ox_data` dataset, you will use it to perform various visualizations to explore and understand the distribution and trends of Oxidant concentrations in different ways.

## Exercise 1: Time Series Plot of Ox Concentrations

**Your Task:**

Create a time series plot to visualize the Ox concentrations over time.

- Title the plot "Ox Concentration Over Time".
- Use the `date.time` for the x-axis and `Ox` for the y-axis.
- Label the axes appropriately.

```{r}
# Code for time series plot of Ox concentrations
```

Your graph should look something like this:

## Exercise 2: Time Series Plot of Average Ox Concentration by Hour

**Your Task:**

Create a time series plot to visualize the average Ox concentration for each hour in the dataset.

- Title your plot "Average Ox Concentration by Hour".
- Use the `date.time` for the x-axis (ensure it's in hour intervals) and the average `Ox` for the y-axis.
- Label the axes appropriately.

```{r}
# Code for time series plot of average Ox concentration by hour
```
Your graph should look something like this:

## Exercise 3: Scatterplot of Ox Concentration vs. Time Colored by Pollutant

**Your Task:**

Generate a scatterplot to observe Ox concentration over time, distinguishing between NO2 and O3 pollutants.

- Title your plot "Ox Concentration Over Time by Pollutant".
- Color the points based on the type of pollutant (NO2 or O3).
- Label the axes appropriately and ensure the time on the x-axis is readable.

```{r}
# Code for scatterplot of Ox concentration vs. time
```
Your graph should look something like this:
![](ox_conc_color.png)
