# (Optional) Exercise 6: Sum_multiples

**Your Task:**

Write a function called `sum_multiples` that takes a numeric value `n` as its input. The function should return the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that are multiples of 3 or 5.

**Consider:** If you're comfortable with this chapter's topics, the solution can be straightforward. Also, there could be multiple approaches. However, it's totally fine if this is out of your reach at this point.

```{r}
# Complete the code below and run the cell.

sum_multiples <- function(n) {
  # Your code here
}
```

#### Test Your Code (Exercise 6)

Do not modify the cell below. Run the cell below to check if your code is correct.

```{r}
library(testthat)

# Unittest for Exercise 6
test_that("Exercise 6: Sum_multiples", {
  expect_equal(sum_multiples(10), 23)
  expect_equal(sum_multiples(0), 0)
})
```
