Our ultimate goal is not to be an exhaustive resource for all environmental chemist. Rather, were focused on developing broadly applicable data science course content (tutorials and recipes) based in R for undergraduate environmental chemistry courses. Note that none of this has been reviewed yet and is not implemented in any capacity in any curriculum.

The latest build as of March 2021 is v4.0.5. Download the appropriate version of R for your Operating System here. We recommend using the default settings for installation (i.e. just keep clicking Next). Note that you will not need shortcuts for launching R, as you will always be using Rstudio to run provided code. Once R is installed on your computer, you will need to download and install RStudio. Download the appropriate version of RStudio for your Operating System here Again, just use the default installation settings. 1.2 Where to get help While its often tempting to contact your TA/Prof at the sign of first trouble, its often better to try and resolve your issues on your own, especially if theyre related to technical issues in R. Given the popularity of R, if youve run into an issue, someone else has and theyve complained about it and someone else has solved it! An oft unappreciated aspect of coding/data science is knowing how to get help, how to search for it, and how to translate someones solutions to your unique situation. Places to get help include: Stack overflow Using built-in documentation (?help) reference book such as the invaluable (R for Data Science)[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html], which inspired this entire project. All else fails,holler at your TA/profs.

This is by no means the only way to work, but its tried and true and will serve you well as you tackle your coursework. 3.1 Creating an RStudio Project When you open RStudio for the first time, this is what you should see: RStudio Default View The version of R you just installed should appear in the main window here: RStudio - R Version (If this message does not appear, go to Tools-&gt;Global Options and make sure that the R version box is set to the correct folder.) Before doing anything else, lets create an R Project. This will establish a default folder for RStudio and bundle together all your code files in one place. Go to File-&gt;New Project. Click New Directory, then New Project. Next, youll be asked to choose a subdirectory name and location. The name can be whatever you want, but we highly recommend that you create the directory in the same parent folder as your data. Click Create Project, and you should now see your chosen file path displayed in the bottom-right window: RStudio Project Folder You are now ready to use R! If youre in a hurry, you can skip straight to Chapter 2: Organizing Your Data, but we recommend you finish this chapter to familiarize yourself with RStudios layout. 3.2 Navigating RStudio RStudio has 4 main windows, 3 of which should currently be visible. To see the fourth window, go to File-&gt;New File-&gt;R Script. You should now be able to see all 4 main windows: RStudio Quadrants 3.2.1 R Environment This window is the least important for our purposes. In brief, it will list all variables, packages, and functions which you have run since opening RStudio. 3.2.2 Viewer The Viewer window has a couple of useful tabs. We will mainly use it to export plots (more on that in later chapters), but you can also open code files from the Files tab without having to leave RStudio. 3.2.3 Console This is where you can type and run code directly, but you will mainly be using the Scripts window to run code (see below). Your primary use of the console will be for installing packages (more on that later). Another thing that the Console window is useful for is quick arithmetic. Try typing 2+2 in the console, then hit Enter. 2+2 ## [1] 4 3.2.4 Scripts R code files are called scripts, and are saved as *.R files. Whenever you copy code blocks from this website, paste them into the Scripts window. You can then run specific lines by highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac), or clicking the Run button in the top right of this window. 3.3 Dark Mode Lastly, some of you may be interested in how to set RStudio to Dark Mode. Simply go to Tools-&gt;Global Options, then click Appearance on the left. Then select your preferred Editor Theme from the list. (My personal preference is Tomorrow Night Bright) RStudio Dark Themes "],["intro-to-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Intro to Data Analysis", " Chapter 4 Intro to Data Analysis introducing the import -&gt; tidy -&gt; transform &lt;-&gt; visualize &lt;-&gt; model &lt;-&gt; communicate workflow map where theyll learn these in the upcoming sections emphasis this is how they should tackle every problem from now on.
