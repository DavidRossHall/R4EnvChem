<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Running R Code</h1>
<p>As we saw last chapter, you can run code directly from the console. It’s handy for short and sweet snippets of code, something that can be typed in a single line. Examples of this is the <code>install.packages()</code> function, or to use R as a calculator:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Where to run code in RStudio</h2>
<p>However, running code like this often isn’t very legible. Imagine printing a book one sentence at a time, you couldn’t really go back and edit earlier work because it’s already printed. That’s why we write out code in <em>scripts</em>. <em>Scripts</em> are similar to recipes, in that they’re a series of instructions that R evaluates from the top of the script to the bottom. More importantly, writing your code out in a script makes it <em>more readable</em> you humans (presumably this includes you). This cannot be understated as your code will evaluate in seconds or minutes whereas it may take you hours to understand what it does.</p>
<p>Let’s open up a new script in RStudio by going to <em>File</em>-&gt;<em>New File</em>-&gt;<em>R Script</em>, or by clicking on the highlighted button in the image below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Rstudio_newscript.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2.5: Opening a new script in RStudio.</p>
</div>
<p>This should open up a new window in the RStudio interface, as shown in the following image.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2.6: Scripts window in RStudio.</p>
</div>
<p>Whenever you copy code blocks from this website (or other online sources), you should paste them into the Scripts window. You can then run the specific lines of code by highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac), or by clicking the “Run” button in the top right corner of the Scripts window.</p>

<div id="variables" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Variables</h3>
<p>Variables in R, like those you’ve encouintered in math class, can only have one value. Unliuke the variables in math classes, you can change that value whenever you want. Another way to think about it is to treat variables in R like a box which you use to store a value. Then you can simply open the box somewhere else without having to worry about the hassle of what’s inside.</p>
<p>You can assign the outputs variables using <code>&lt;-</code>, as shown below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">12</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb16-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>In addition to reading code top to bottom, you often <em>read it from right to left</em>. <code>x &lt;- 12</code> would be read as “store the numerical value of 6.0221e23 into the variable x.” The second line of code, <code>x</code>, simply returns the value stored inside <code>x</code>. You can now use this variable in snippets of code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> x <span class="sc">*</span> <span class="fl">6.022e23</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb20-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 7.2264e+24</code></pre>
<p>Remember, we’re evaluating from right to left, so the code above is taking the number <code>6.022e23</code> and multiplying it by the value of <code>x</code>, which is 12 and storing that value back into <code>x</code>. Note that variable names are case sensitive, so if your variable is named <code>x</code> and you type <code>X</code> into the console, R will not be able to print the contents of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Variables can containe single values, character strings (text) or logical statements (<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>) to variables using the same notation.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>fifty <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">50</span></span>

<p>Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, dots (<code>.</code>) and/or underlines (<code>_</code>). Before you create variables of your own. Here are some rules and guidelines for naming variables in R:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules</strong> dictated by R
<ul>
<li>names must begin with a letter or with the dot character, as long as not followed by a number. <code>var</code> and <code>.var</code> are acceptable.</li>
<li>Variable names <em>cannot</em> start with a number or the <code>.</code> character cannot be preceeded by number. <code>var1</code> is acceptable, <code>1var</code> and <code>.1var</code> are not.</li>
<li>Variable names <em>cannot</em> contain a space. <code>var 1</code> is interperated as two separate values, <code>var</code> and <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>Certain words are reserved for R, and cannot be used as variable names. These include, but are not limited to, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, <code>NULL</code>, <code>Inf</code>, <code>NA</code>, and `NaN</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Good names for variables are short, sweet, and easy to type while also being somewhat descriptive. For example, let’s say you have an air pollution data set. A good name to assign the data set to would be <code>airPol</code> or <code>air_pol</code>, as these names tell us what is contained in the data set and are easy to type. A bad name for the data set would be <code>airPollution_NOx_O3_June20_1968</code>. While this name is much more descriptive than the previous names, it will take you a long time to type, and will become a bit of a nuisance when you have to type it 10+ times to refer to the data set in a single script. Please refer to the <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html"><em>Style Guide</em></a> found in <em>Advanced R</em> by H. Wickham for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-types" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Data Types</h3>
<p>Data types refer to how data is stored and handled by and in R. You can really get into the weeds on this, but we’ll focus on the most common types so you can get started on your work. Firstly, here are the data types you’ll likely be working with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>character</strong>: <code>"a"</code>, <code>"howdy"</code>, <code>"1"</code>, is used to represent string values in R. Basically it’s text that you’d read. Note the quotation marks and the fact that <code>"1"</code>, despite being a number, is stored as a character.</li>
<li><strong>numeric</strong> (real or decimal): <code>2</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>6.022e23</code>.</li>
<li><strong>intgeger</strong>: <code>2L</code>, note the ‘L’ tells R this is an integer.</li>
<li><strong>logical</strong>: either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some helpful functions to test the data type of a value in R as a frequent source of error and frustration are values stored in the wrong data type. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">&quot;6&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb28-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb28-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="sc">/</span> <span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Error in x/2: non-numeric argument to binary operator</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see the error above frequently, and it’s simply saying you’re trying to do math on something you can’t do math on. You might think if x is 6, why can’t I divide it by 2? Let’s see what type of data <code>x</code> is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">is.numeric</span>(x)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">is.logical</span>(x)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb34-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb34-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">is.integer</span>(x)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb36-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb36-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">is.character</span>(x)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>So the value of <code>x</code> is a character, in otherwords R treats it as a word, and we can’t do math on that (think, how would you divide a word by a number?). So let’s convert the data type of <code>x</code> to numeric to proceed.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb38-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb38-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">as.numeric</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb38-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb38-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">is.numeric</span>(x)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb40-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="sc">/</span> <span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>So we’ve converted our chjracter string <code>"6"</code> to the numerical value <code>6</code>. Keep in mind there are other conversion functions which are described <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conversion-functions-in-r-programming/">elsewhere</a>, but you can’t always convert types. In the above example we could convert a chracter to numeric because it was ultimately a number, but we couldn’t do the same if the value of <code>x</code> was <code>"six"</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Data Structures</h3>

<p>The above is air quality data measured in downtown Toronto around July 2018. Some of the variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>naps</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code> to tell you where the data was measured.</li>
<li><code>data.time</code> for when the measurements were taking.</li>
<li><code>pollutant</code> for the chemical measured</li>
<li><code>concentration</code> for the measured concentration in parts-per-million (ppm).</li>
</ul>
<p>R has several data structures which will be briefly introduced here. There are many freely available resources online which dive more in depth into different data structures in R. If you are interested in learning more about different structures, you can check out the <em>Data structures</em> chapter of <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html"><em>Advanced R</em></a> by Hadley Wickham, one of the authors of the <em>R for Data Science</em> referenced in the Introduction.</p>
<p>Data structures in R include vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames. Vectors and lists are examples of one dimensional data structures, while matrices and data frames are examples of two dimensional data structures.</p>
<p><strong>Vectors</strong> contain multiple elements of the same type; either numeric, character (text), logical, or integer. Vectors are created using <code>c()</code>, which is short for combine. Some examples of vectors are shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> are similar to vectors in that they are one dimensional data structures which contain multiple elements. However, lists can contain multiple elements of different types, while vectors only contain a single type of data. You can create lists using <code>list()</code>. Some examples of lists are shown below. You can use <code>str()</code> to reveal the different components of a list, in a more detailed format than if you were to simply type the assigned name of the list.</p>

<p><strong>Matrices</strong> and <strong>data frames</strong> are two dimensional data structures, similar to tables you would create in Excel. Matrices are created using <code>matrix()</code>, and three internal arguments; <code>data</code>, <code>ncol</code>, and <code>nrow</code>. An example of a matrix is shown below.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> R packages and functions</h3>
<p>While there are many functions and operations available in base R, sometimes you may need to perform a task which base R functions do not cover. Fortunately, there are many R packages freely available online, each with their own suite of functions and capabilities. Some commonly used packages for data visualization and organization include <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>dplyr</code>. These are both included in the <code>tidyverse</code> package, which will be used in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>In order to use an R package, you need to install the package in R. Usually this is done in the console, using the command <code>install.packages()</code>. You would then load the package into R, using the command <code>library()</code>. The <code>ggplot2</code> package is installed and loaded below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb55-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ggplot2&quot;</span>)</span>

<p>While you only need to install a package once, you will need to reload it every time you start a new R session or open a new R project. We will expand on R sessions and R projects Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Now that we have installed and loaded <code>ggplot2</code>, we can use the <code>ggplot</code> function to to visualize some data. First, we’re going load the <code>readr</code> package, and use the <code>read_csv()</code> function to import some ozone concentration data. We will then use <code>ggplot()</code> with <code>geom_point()</code> to plot the ozone concentration over time in a scatter plot.</p>

<div id="script-formatting" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Script formatting</h2>
<p>You should now be familiar with how to open the Scripts window, as well as some of the advantages of typing your code into this window rather than into the console directly. Before you write your first script, let’s review some basic script formatting.</p>
<p>Before you enter any code into your script, it is good practice to fill the first few lines with text comments which indicate the script’s title, author, and creation or last edit date. You can create a comment in a script by typing <code>#</code> before your text. An example is given below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb57-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb57-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Title: Ozone time series script</span></span>
<span id="cb57-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb57-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Author: Georgia Green</span></span>
<span id="cb57-3"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb57-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Date: January 8, 2072</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Below your script header, you should include any packages that need to be loaded for the script to run. Including the necessary packages at the top of the script allows you, and anyone you share your code with, to easily see what packages they need to install. This also means that if you decide to run an entire script at once, the necessary packages will always be loaded before any subsequent code that requires those packages to work.</p>
<p>The first few lines of your scripts should look something like the following.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb58-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb58-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Title: Ozone time series script</span></span>

<span id="cb58-6"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb58-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(dplyr)</span>
<span id="cb58-7"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb58-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(ggplot2)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rest of your script should be dedicated to executable code. It is good practice to include text comments throughout the script, in between different chunks of code, to remind yourself what the different sections of code are for (i.e., <code>#import packages</code> in the above example). This also makes it easy for anyone you share your code with to understand what you’re trying to do with different sections within the script.</p>
<p>You can also use headers and sub-headers in your scripts using <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> before your text. Headings are written with a single hash-tag, followed by a space, as shown below. Subheadings are written with two hash-tags, followed by a space, also shown below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb59-1"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb59-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Heading Text</span></span>
<span id="cb59-2"><a href="running-r-code-1.html#cb59-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Subheading Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Headings and subheadings are picked up by RStudio and displayed in the Document Outline box. You can open the Document Outline box by clicking the button highlighted in the image below. Use of these headings allows easy navigation of long scripts, as you can navigate between sections using the Document Outline box.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Viewing data and code simultaneously</h2>
<p>Before we get into more about coding and workflows, you may want to know how to view your scripts and data side-by-side. You can open a script, plot, or data set in a new window by clicking and dragging the tab in RStudio (may not be compatible with Mac), or by clicking the button highlighted in the image below.</p>
