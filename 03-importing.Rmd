# Importing

Before you can start analyzing data and answer questions you need to import your data into Excel. Furthermore, data can be saved in many formats, each with their own advantages, quirks, and limitations.

##	Importing data into Excel

Thankfully importing data into Excel is (usually) very easy and if you’ve ever used it before, you probably haven’t given it much though. Simply find whatever file containing your data and open it with Excel; consult the *[Import or export text (.txt or .csv) files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba)* instructions from Microsoft for further instructions.

For Experiment 1, open Microsoft Excel and then open your dataset by clicking FILE  OPEN  BROWSE and select your file. You should see something resembling Figure 2. You may be prompted with a dialog warning you of “data loss when saving as CSV”. Excel is simply warning you that certain features (changes in font, plots, formulas) cannot be saved in the CSV file format. Consequently, your first step is to **save your data as an excel workbook (.xlsx)** to avoid this issue. Instructions for [saving can be found here](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10550424-no-more-warnings-about-saving-as-csv-especially-w).

##	Notes on comma-separated values (CSV) files

The CSV file extension stands for comma-separate values file, a popular file format for storing data, and the one used for the Experiment 1 datasets. You are bound to encounter CSV files again in your academic careers. As the name implies, CSV files contain data separated by commas (go ahead and open your file in Notepad/TextEdit or Microsoft Word to see this). The takeaway with .csv files is they are good for storing data, and only data. If your work in Excel relies upon complex formatting (such as colour coding) save your work in the .xlsx format. These elements will not be saved in the .csv format.  


##	Notes on filenames

Filenames contain two parts: the actual name and an extension specifying the file type (i.e. ImportantData.csv). Knowing the later is incredibly helpful, especially if you’re working with multiple file types. However, filename extensions are often hidden by default. To display the full filename, follow these instructions for Windows ( or Mac OSX).
