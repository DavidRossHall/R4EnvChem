# Using R Markdown

Before going into more details of R Markdown, let's talk about two common options in the world of R coding: the R script (.R) and the dynamic R Markdown document (.Rmd).

**R Scripts**: Imagine coding as crafting a detailed recipe of R commands---a script---that guides R through specific tasks. Conventional R scripts (.R files) are dedicated to these commands, handling calculations and operations. However, as scripts grow, they become complex and sharing insights alongside code becomes challenging.

**R Markdown**: R Markdown (.Rmd) elevates the coding experience by harmonizing code with explanatory text. Within an R Markdown document, code blocks act like individual scripts---smaller, more focused units. These blocks merge code with explanations seamlessly, creating a coherent narrative. Unlike isolated scripts, R Markdown emphasizes both code functionality and its significance within the context. For these reasons, we'll be sticking to working in `.Rmd` files.

In a nutshell, R Markdown allows you to analyse your data with R and write your report in the same place (this entire book was written with R Markdown). This has loads of benefits including a [*reproducible workflow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw), and streamlined thinking. No more flipping back and forth between coding and writing to figure out what's going on.

Let's run some simple code as an example:

```{r}
x <- 2+2
x
```

What we've done here is write a snippet of R code, ran it, and printed the results (as they would appear in the console). While the above code isn't anything special, we can extend this concept so that our R Markdown document contains any data, figures or plots we generate throughout our analysis in R. For example here is a time series of 2018 ambient atmospheric O~3~, NO~2~, and SO~2~ concentrations (ppb) in downtown Toronto:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=2}
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr)

airPol <- read_csv("data/2018-01-01_60430_Toronto_ON.csv")

ggplot(data = airPol, 
       aes(x = date.time, 
           y = concentration, 
           colour = pollutant)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()

sumAirPol <- airPol %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(city, naps, pollutant) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(concentration), 
            sd = sd(concentration), 
            min = min(concentration), 
            max = max(concentration))

knitr::kable(sumAirPol, digits = 1)
```

Pretty neat, eh? You might not think so, but let's imagine a scenario you'll encounter soon enough. You're about to submit your assignment, you've spent hours analyzing your data and beautifying your plots. Everything is good to go until you notice at the last minute you were supposed to *subtract* value `x` and not value `y` in your analysis. If you did all your work in *Excel* (tsk tsk), you'll need to find the correct worksheet, apply the changes, reformat your plots, and import them into word (assuming everything is going well, which it never does with looming deadlines). Now if you did all your work in R Markdown, you go to your one `.rmd` document, briefly apply the changes and re-compile your document.

A lot of scientists work with R Markdown for writing their reports for numerous reasons:

1.  **Integrated Workflow**: Combines narrative, data analyses, and visualizations in one document, promoting reproducibility and transparency.
2.  **Versatility**: Easily exports to diverse formats like HTML, PDF, and Word, catering to different dissemination needs.
3.  **Plot Management**: Offers precise control over visual presentations, allowing for tailored figure sizes, resolutions, and formats.

In sum, R Markdown provides a streamlined platform for scientific communication, merging data analysis with polished publication seamlessly.

## Getting Started with R Markdown

As you've already guessed, R Markdown documents use R and are most easily written and assembled in RStudio. If you have not done so, revisit Chapter 1: [Intro to R and RStudio]. Once setup with R and RStudio, you'll need to install the `R Markdown` and `tinytex` packages by running the following code in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# These are large packages so it'll take a couple of minutes to install
install.packages("R Markdown")
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

The `R Markdown` package is what we'll use to generate our documents, and the `tinytex` package enables compiling documents as PDFs. There's a lot more going on [behind the scenes](https://R%20Markdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html), but you shouldn't need to worry about it.

Now that everything is set up, you can create your first R Markdown document by opening up RStudio, selecting `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`. A dialog box will appear asking for some basic information for your R Markdown document. Add your title and select *PDF* as your default output format (you can always change these later if you want). A new file should appear using a basic template that illustrates the key components of an R Markdown document.

### Understanding R Markdown

Your first reaction when you opened your newly created R Markdown document is probably that it doesn't look anything at all like something you'd show your prof. You're right, what you're seeing is the plain text code which needs to be *knit*  to create the final document. When you create a R Markdown document like this in R Studio a bunch of example code is already written. You can knit this document (see below) to see what it looks like, but let's break down the primary components. At the top of the document you'll see something that looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Temporal Analysis of Foot Impacts While Birling Down the White Water"
author: "Jean Guy Rubberboots"
date: "24/06/2021"
output: pdf_document
---
```

This section is known as the *preamble* and it's where you specify most of the document parameters. In the example we can see that the document title is ["Temporal Analysis of Foot Impacts While Birling Down the White Water"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upsZZ2s3xv8), it's written by Jean Guy Rubberboots, on the 24th of June, and the default output is a PDF document. You can modify the preamble to suit your needs. For example, if you wanted to change the title you would write `title: "Your Title Here"` in the preamble.

#### Output Options in R Markdown

You can compile your entire document using the *Knit document* button. This is a great way to tinker with your code before you compile your document. Knitting will sequentially run all of your code chunks, generate all the text, knit the two together and output a PDF. You'll basically save this for the end.

R Markdown offers flexibility in terms of output formats, allowing users to knit their documents into various outputs tailored to their needs.

**Three Common Output Options:**

-   **HTML** (`html_document`): Produces an HTML file, suitable for hosting on websites or for sharing via email. This format allows for interactive content, making it ideal for interactive graphs or web applications.

-   **PDF** (`pdf_document`): Creates a PDF file. This format is best for documents intended for print or formal submissions, as it maintains consistent formatting across different devices and platforms.

-   **Word** (`word_document`): Generates a Microsoft Word document, which can be useful when sharing drafts or collaborating with colleagues who use Word for edits.

**Controlling the Output:**

-   **Modifying the metadata header**: You can change the output format directly in the header of your R Markdown file. In the last example, replacing `output: pdf_document` with `output: html_document` or `output: word_document` would knit the document into HTML or Word, respectively.

-   **Using RStudio's Knit Button**: In RStudio, at the top of the script editor pane, there's a Knit button. Clicking the small dropdown arrow next to this button allows you to choose the output format you desire. Selecting one of the options will knit the document into that format and update the header accordingly.

### Running Code in R Markdown

#### How to Create Code Chunks

To create a code chunk within RStudio, you have several options:

1.  Use the green "c" button located at the top right corner of your file view and select "R". Make sure your cursor is positioned at the desired location within your .rmd file when you do this.

    ![](images/rmd_codeblock_1.png)

2.  Type ```` ```{r} ```` -- three back-ticks followed by `{r}` -- to initiate a new code chunk, and type ```` ``` ```` -- three backticks (\`\`\`) -- to end the code chunk. You can specify code chunk options in the curly brackets. i.e. ```` ```{r, fig.height = 2} ```` sets figure height to 2 inches. See the *Code Chunk Options* section below for more details.

    ![](images/rmd_codeblock_2.png)

3.  Inline code expression, which starts with `` `r `` and ends with `` ` `` in the body text. Earlier we calculated `x <- 2 + 2`, we can use inline expressions to recall that value.

    ![When we knit the markdown file shown in the figure, the knitted document will say "We found that *x* is 4."](images/inline_code.png)

#### How to Run Code Chunks

To run code within an R Markdown document, you again have various options to choose from.

1.  You can run a specific code chunk by clicking the green triangle button located within each chunk. This action will execute the entire chunk, including all the code it contains.

    ![](images/run_code_1.png)

2.  For more control, you can run selected lines or chunks. To do this, use the "Run" button at the top of the file view. This button provides a range of execution options that allow you to run code in a manner that suits your needs.

    ![](images/run_code_2.png)
    
    ![](images/run_code_3.png)
    
    **Note all the code chunks in a single document work together like a normal R script.** That is, if you assign a value to a variable in the first chunk, you can use this variable in the second chunk. **Also note that every time you knit an R Markdown document, it's done in a "fresh" R session.** If you're using a variable that exist in your working environment, but isn't explicitly created in the document, you'll get an error.

### Headings and Subheadings

Structure your document with clear headings and subheadings by using the pound (`#`) sign. This not only helps in organizing content but also aids in creating a table of contents if required.
The level of heading is denoted by the number of `#` signs, as you saw with R script headings in the previous section.

-   **Main Headings**: Use a single pound sign (i.e. `# Main Heading`)
-   **Subheadings**: Increase the number of pound signs based on the level of the subheading.
    -   `## Subheading Level 1`
    -   `### Subheading Level 2`
    -   `#### Subheading Level 3`

R Markdown will automatically format these appropriately when the document is knit. For example, a main heading will typically appear larger and bolder than its subheadings, like this:

![](images/heading_example.png){width="40%"}

By effectively utilizing headings and subheadings, you can provide clear structure and flow to your document, making it more readable and navigable for your audience.

### LaTeX Basics

**LaTeX** (pronounced "lay-tech") is a typesetting system that's popular in academia due to its high-quality output format and the ability to handle complex formatting tasks. It's especially favored for documents that contain mathematical symbols, equations, and other specialized notation.

In R Markdown, LaTeX code can be integrated directly into text chunks to allow for advanced formatting, especially for mathematical expressions and equations. When you knit your R Markdown document, the LaTeX code is rendered into beautifully formatted text. _Note_: LaTeX code should always be written in text chunks, not code chunks!

There are two common ways to turn your expressions in a math mode.

1.  **Display mathematical expressions**: centers the mathematical expression on its own line.
2.  **Inline mathematical expressions**: appears within the text of a paragraph.

For chemistry students, one common use of LaTeX is to typeset chemical equations. We will provide examples on the combustion of methane:

![](images/methane_example.jpeg){width="50%"}

#### Display math mode

You can have an entire line in a math mode using either `\[...\]` or `$$...$$`.
For example, writing the following in R Markdown

-   `\[ \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \]`

produces the following output in the generated PDF:

\[ \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \]

#### Inline math mode

On the other hand, if you want to insert your expression within your sentence, you can use `$...$` syntax.

With our methane combustion example, we can write something like this:

-   `Methane ($\text{CH}_4$) reacts with oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).`

When you knit it, this will be displayed as:

-   Methane ($\text{CH}_4$) reacts with oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).

#### Useful LaTeX Syntax

Now that you've seen how you can write your scientific expression in two different ways, let's look at some useful LaTeX Syntax for our purpose.

1.  **Symbols**
    -   Greek letters: Use a backslash followed by the name of the letter, e.g., `\alpha` for $\alpha$.
    -   Special symbols
        -   `\times` for $\times$
        -   `\approx` for $\approx$
        -   `\geq` for $\geq$
        -   `\rightarrow` for $\rightarrow$
2.  **Superscripts and Subscripts**
    -   Superscripts: `x^2` renders as $x^2$.
    -   Subscripts: `H_2O` renders as $H_2O$
3.  **Formatting**
    -   Boldface: `\textbf{Text}` for $\textbf{Text}$
    -   Italics: `\textit{Text}` for $\textit{Text}$

*Tip*: In RStudio, you can place your cursor over LaTeX code to preview its generated output.

#### More LaTeX Resources

There are numerous online resources dedicated to LaTeX symbols and their usage.

-   A popular starting point is the [Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List](https://mirror.its.dal.ca/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf). This extensive compilation offers a wide range of symbols used in various disciplines.
-   Platforms like [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) allow users to sketch a symbol, and the tool then identifies the corresponding LaTeX command.
-   Engaging with online communities, such as the [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), can also be invaluable for finding specific symbols or seeking advice on LaTeX-related challenges.

## Compiling your final report

To hand in your work, you'll need to knit your document to generate a PDF. To knit your R Markdown file, click the *knit* button in RStudio (yellow box, Figure 2).

## Authoring with R Markdown

Below is a brief summary of the major elements required to author an R Markdown document. They should address the majority of your needs, but please see the [R Markdown resources] for more information.

### R Markdown Syntax

Unlike *Microsoft Word*, R Markdown utilizes a specific syntax for text formatting. Once you get used to it, it makes typing documents much easier than *Word*'s approach. The table below is how some of the most common text formatting is typed in your R Markdown document (syntax & example column) and how it'll appear in the final output.

| Text formatting |       syntax |                 Example |        Example output |
|-----------------|-------------:|------------------------:|----------------------:|
| italics         |     \*text\* |     this is \*italics\* |     this is *italics* |
| bold            | \*\*text\*\* |    this is \*\*bold\*\* |      this is **bold** |
| subscript       |     \~text\~ |   this is \~subscript\~ |   this is ~subscript~ |
| superscript     |     \^text\^ | this is \^superscript\^ | this is ^superscript^ |
| monospace       |     \`text\` |  this is \`monospaced\` |   this is `monospace` |

For a collection of other R Markdown syntax, please see the useful (and brief) list compiled online [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).

### R Code Chunk Options

Your R code is run in chunks and the results will be embedded in the final output file. To each chunk you can specify options that'll affect how your code chunk is run and displayed in the final output document. You include options in the chunk delimiters ```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````. For example the following options indicate that the code chunk contains R code, that when you knit your document the code in this chunk should be evaluated, and that the resulting figure should have the caption "Some Caption".

```` markdown
`r ''````{r, eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Some caption"}

# some code to generate a plot worth captioning. 

```
````

The most common and useful chunk options are shown below. Note that they all have a default value. For example, `eval` tells R Markdown whether the code within the block should be run. It's default option is `TRUE`, so by default any code in a chunk will be run when you knit your document. If you don't want that code to be run, but still displayed, you would set `eval = FALSE`. Another example would be setting `echo = FALSE` which allows the code to run, but the code *won't* be displayed on the output document (the outputs will still be displayed though); useful for creating clean documents with plots only (i.e. lab reports...).

| option     | default | effect                                                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| eval       | TRUE    | whether to evaluate the code and include the results      |
| echo       | TRUE    | whether to display the code along with its results        |
| warning    | TRUE    | whether to display warnings                               |
| error      | FALSE   | whether to display errors                                 |
| message    | TRUE    | whether to display messages                               |
| tidy       | FALSE   | whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it |
| fig.width  | 7       | width in inches for plots created in chunk                |
| fig.height | 7       | height in inches for plots created in chunk               |
| fig.cap    | NA      | include figure caption, must be in quotation makrs ("")   |

### Inserting images

Images not produced by R code can easily be inserted into your document.

``` markdown
![Caption for the picture.](path/to/image.png){width=50%, height=50%}
```

Note that in the above the use of image attributes, the `{width=50%, height=50%}` at the end. This is how you'll adjust the size of your image. Size dimensions you can use include `px, cm, mm, in, inch`, and `%`.

A final note on images: when compiling to PDF, your image will be placed in the "optimal" location (as determined by LaTeX), so you might find your image isn't exactly where you thought it would be. A more in-depth guide to image placement can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/RatherBit/90926).

### Generating tables

There are multiple ways of creating tables in R Markdown. Assuming you want to display results calculated through R code, you can use the `kable()` function. Or you can consult the [Summarizing Data] chapter for making publication ready tables.

Alternatively, if you want to create simple tables manually use the following code in the main body, outside of an `R` code chunk. You can increase the number of rows/columns and the location of the horizontal lines. To generate more complex tables, see the `kable()` function and the `kableExtra` package.

``` markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3        |
|:---------|:---------|:----------------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Some other Data |
| Row 2    | Data     | Some other Data |
```

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3        |
|:---------|:---------|:----------------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Some other Data |
| Row 2    | Data     | Some other Data |

We know this can be a tedious process. Luckily, there is a website that generates the markdown syntax when you input the values, and this can save your time trying to correctly format tables. Check it out [here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

### Spellcheck in R Markdown

While writing an R Markdown document in R studio, go to the `Edit` tab at the top of the window and select `Check Spelling`. You can also use the `F7` key as a shortcut. The spell checker will literally go through every word it thinks you've misspelled in your document. You can add words to it so your spell checker's utility grows as you use it. **Note** that the spell check may also check your R code; be wary of changing words in your code chunks because you may get an error down the line.

### Exporting R Markdown documents

You'll most likely be exporting your R Markdown documents as PDFs, but the beauty of R Markdown is it doesn't stop there. Your R Markdown documents can be knitted as a HTML document, a book (or both like this book!). You can even make slideshow presentations and yes, if need be, export as a word document that you can open in *Microsoft Word*.

You specify the output format in the document header. To specify you want your document to be outputted as a PDF your header would look like this:

``` markdown
---
title: "Your title here"
output: pdf_document
---
```

Here are some links to different output formation available in R Markdown and how to use them:

-   [`pdf_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/pdf-document.html) creates a PDF document via Latex; probably your defacto output.
-   [`word_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/word-document.html) creates a Word document. Note that the formatting options are pretty basic, so while everything will be where you want it to be, you'll need to pretty it up in Word to comply with your instructor's specifications.
-   [`tufte_handout`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/tufte-handouts.html) for a PDF handout in the style of Edward Tufte. Check it out.
-   [`ioslides_presentation`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/ioslides-presentation.html), [`revealjs::revealjs_presentation`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/ioslides-presentation.html), and [`powerpoint_presentation`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/powerpoint-presentation.html) are all options to create slideshow presentations. `revealjs` has the steepest learning curve of the bunch, but once set up, you can make incredibly slick slides with ease.
    -   Note: like `word_document`, `powerpoint_presentation`'s outputs are stylistically simple. You'll definitely need to pretty them up manually in Powerpoint.

### RStudio tips and tricks

To further the usefulness of R Markdown, the latest release of RStudio has a *Visual R Markdown* editor which introduces many useful features for authoring documents in R Markdown. Some of the most pertinent are:

-   [Visual editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/) so you can see how your document looks (top left of script pane)
-   Combining Zotero and RStudio for easy citations, of your document (read more [here](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html))

## R Markdown resources

There's a plethora of helpful online resources to help hone your R Markdown skills. We'll list a couple below (the titles are links to the corresponding document):

-   [Chapter 2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/basics.html) of the [*R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/R%20Markdown/) by Xie, Allaire & Grolemund (2020). This is the simplest, most comprehensive, guide to learning R Markdown and it's available freely online.
-   [*The R Markdown cheat sheet*](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/R%20Markdown-cheatsheet.pdf), a great resource with the most common R Markdown operations; keep on hand for quick referencing.
-   [*Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) (2020) by Yihui Xie. Explains the `bookdown` package which greatly expands the capabilities of R Markdown. For example, the table of contents of this document is created with `bookdown`.
