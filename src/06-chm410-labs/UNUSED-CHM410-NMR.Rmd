# CHM410: NMR Lab

*This chapter written by J. Gauthier for CHM410*

## Getting started

Welcome to the NMR lab for CHM410. You should have arrived here by following the lab manual, however if you've jumped ahead then please go back and complete the first portion of the lab (Spectral processing).

In this second half of the NMR lab, we will be using R to perform statistical analysis on your sample. Is your sample actually what it claims? Do the sugars you identified make sense? Here is where you are going to determine the authenticity of your sample, with reference to a set of characterized NMR samples.

You will need a copy of the *database of characterized NMR samples*, available from Quercus.

## Setting up your workspace

Start with a clean working directory, existing files could complicate things later. Extract the *supplied NMR dataset* into your working directory. You can leave all the `.csv` files in their subfolders, we will be using code that searches recursively through the entire working directory for appropriate `.csv` files.

While we could perform this analysis manually, it will be significantly easier with the help of a package designed for spectroscopic, statistical analysis. It is important to note that not all R packages are created equal. If you can perform the data analysis without relying on third party packages then you are not at the mercy of these developers to maintain their packages. However, the [ChemoSpec](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/index.html) package is well maintained and thoroughly documented, I think we will be safe.

## Import and install the appropriate packages

Install and load the `ChemoSpec` package and its dependencies as outlined in [Installing packages].

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ChemoSpec")
install.packages("R.utils")
install.packages("robustbase")
library("ChemoSpec")
library("ggplot2")
library("R.utils")
```

To see complete details about the ChemoSpec package, including step-by-step instructions, run the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

browseVignettes("ChemoSpec")

```

## Exporting your NMR for R and ChemoSpec

At this point in the lab, you should have a processed spectra in MestreNova. Your spectra should be referenced to the internal standard peak at 0.0 ppm, it should also be properly phased and baseline corrected.

Next, we need to prepare the spectra for import into R. All the spectra in the **supplied dataset** contain `131,071` points. You will need to make sure your spectra also contains `131,071` data points. This can be done by zero-filling the spectra in MestreNova.

1. Select the **Processing** tab
2. Select **Zero Filling and LP**
3. Under the **To Spectrum Size** dropdown menu, select **131071** and press **OK**

Now that your spectra is compatible with the rest of the supplied dataset it can be exported as a `.csv` file. MestreNova can be annoying about this, so it is important to follow these steps exactly. Note: you will need to delete all integrated peaks before exporting the spectra. (Otherwise only the integrated peaks will be placed into the `.csv` file)

1. Select **File** and **Save as...**
2. Under **File Type** select **Script: NMR 1D Custom CSV (*csv, *txt)** 
3. Choose an appropriate file name such as "Unknown1", you will be referencing this file shortly.
4. Save the CSV file in your Working Directory for R.
5. A new window will pop up. Ensure you have the correct formatting.

## Importing your data in ChemoSpec

ChemoSpec contains many functions that will simplify our data analysis. The first one we will make use of is `files2SpectraObject()`. This function assumes your files exist as individual CSV files (1 file per sample) within your working directory. This function uses `read.table()`^[Note that `read.table` is from base R, not the `tidyverse` (i.e `read_table()`). Review the function documentation for assistance] to perform the actual importing, but it will also group all your spectra together by name as a `Spectra` object.

Take a look at the following:

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
##Import all NMR spectra in the working directory as one object named spec
spec <- files2SpectraObject(  
  
  ##Search through the entire working directory for CSV files
  recursive = TRUE,  
  
  ##Specify the sample names of interest by inclusive criteria
  gr.crit= c("Sample", "Unknown", "Kirkland", "Manuka", "Maple", "Naturoney", "NoName", "PresidentsChoice", "Starbucks", "SugarSyrup"), 
  
  ##Automatically apply colours to the sample groups
  gr.cols = "Col12",  
  
  ##Define the units of the x-axis
  freq.unit = "ppm",  
  
  ##Define the units of the y-axis
  int.unit = "intensity", 
  
  ##Description of the dataset
  descrip = "NMR PCA Test",
  
  ##Read all files with this extension.
  fileExt = "\\.(csv|CSV)$",  
  
  ##Save this spectra object to an R data file just in case.
  out.file = "410NMRdata"  
)
```

In this function we import all the `.csv`-type spectra that can be found in the working directory as one `Spectra` object called `spec`. If you look in your RStudio Envrionment, you will see a new `Large Spectra` object that consists of 9 elements. Notice how in the line `gr.crit = ...` we defined each sample group as a string. If you look through the supplied dataset you will see each `.csv` file is named according to its sample type *BillyBee1, BillyBee2, ...* `files2SpectraObject` knows that each string defined is a different sample group. If you are wondering how this works you can always type `?files2SpectraObject` in your Console for details.

Next let's make sure the data is imported correctly:

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
sumSpectra(spec)
```

This line of code will print details about the dataset you will be working with.

Finally, you can display any of the spectra in this `Spectra Object` using the following code. Double check that your sample spectra looks the same as it did in MestreNova. 

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## Set the graphics option in ChemoSpec to use ggplot2 instead of base R graphics
options(chemoSpecGraphics = 'ggplot2')

## Plot the spectra in the Spectra object named spec
spectralPlot <- plotSpectra(spec,
            
            ##Which spectra should be plotted? Your spectra is likely number 1 or 34.
            which = c(1, 2, 3),
            
            ##If plotting multiple spectra, offset the vertical axis
            offset = 50,
            
            ##If the spectra is too small, you can scale the y-axis here
            amplify = 1,

            ##Set the position of the sample labels. This is optional and removing the line removes the labels.
            lab.pos = 5, 
 )
 
 ##This line will invert the x-axis to the more familiar NMR axis style
 spectralPlot <- spectralPlot + xlim(10, -1)
 
 ##This line will set the title of your new NMR plot
 spectraPlot <- spectraPlot + ggtitle("NMR Spectra of Sample X")
```

You can also use the function `loopThruSpectra()` to cycle through plots of each spectra in the `spec` Spectra object.


## Preparing the Data for Statistical Analysis

While ChemoSpec offers tools to do baseline correction and signal referencing, we won't use these since we already completed these data pre-processing steps in MestreNova. Our first step in statistical analysis will be to normalize the data. During sample preparation, the procedure may vary from person-to-person and sample-to-sample. NMR samples could have different pH, different dilutions, different solvent ratios, and different salt content; to name a few. It is important to normalize the data to account for these differences before performing statistical analysis. Thankfully ChemoSpec provides a handy function called `normSpectra()`. 

The first thing we will need to do is remove any unimportant or outlier peaks. If you cleaned your NMR tube with a solvent such as acetone, there will be a residual acetone peak at 2.2 ppm. Since some samples have this peak while others don't, and since nothing else in our sample appears around this chemical shift, we can remove all the data between 2.0  and 2.4 ppm. This will avoid confusing our PCA analysis.

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## Remove the acetone region of the NMR spectra across all the data
cleanerSpec <- removeFreq(spec, rem.freq = spec$freq > 2.0 & spec$freq < 2.4)

##Review the spectra set again. Notice how it contains fewer data points than the last time this was run
sumSpectra(cleanerSpec)

```

Since the internal peak should be the same concentration for each sample, and it should appear at the same chemical shift, we will use this peak to normalize all spectra using the following code:

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## Specify the range over which to normalize the spectra.
## Notice spec$freq refers to the frequency dataframe within the spec object
range <- cleanerSpec$freq > -0.5 & cleanerSpec$freq < 0.5

##Create a new Spectra object called norm that contains the normalized data
norm <- normSpectra(cleanerSpec, method = "PQN", RangeExpress = range)

##You can use plotSpectra again to compare one of the original and one of the normalized spectra. You should see a change in intensity.

plotSpectra(cleanerSpec)
plotSpectra(norm)
```

ChemoSpec is a powerful package, it is capable of carefully dealing with large datasets. You can read the vignette for details on how to remove specific peaks, samples, or baseline frequencies. Since all our samples are similar, we will not need these tools during this lab.


## Let's do statistics!

Principal component analysis (PCA from here on) makes no assumptions about your data. PCA looks only for clustering of sample scores. Samples which have similar scores are similar, and appear as clustered together, while samples which are different (such as a fradulent or questionable sugar sample) will normally appear as outliers in the data. In essence, PCA can look past all the noise in the data and draw (hopefully) meaningful conclusions.

While ChemoSpec has a plethora of options for performing PCA, we will stick with a basic approach using classical PCA with no data scaling. The following code will accomplish the analysis and store the results as a `prcomp` object.

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
pca <- c_pcaSpectra(norm, choice = "noscale", cent = TRUE)
```

Here, the function `c_pcaSpectra()` performs a classical principal component analysis on the spectra object, which contains all the supplied dataset samples as well as the sample you supplied.

Finally, we can plot the PCA results using the following code. I encourage you to review the ChemoSpec documentation and customize this plot as you see appropriate.

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## Create a plot of PCA scores for all data points
pcaPlot <- plotScores(cleanerSpec, 
           pca, 
           
           ## Which principal components to include. 99% of the time this will be the first 2 loadings, however if the scree plot indicates the 3rd to be important, it might be worth including.
           pcs = c(1,2), 
           
           ##  Which type of ellipse should the analysis draw on this plot
           ellipse = "rob", 
           
           ##  If symbols are easier to see for you than colours, set this to TRUE
           use.sym = FALSE,
           
           ##  This value sets the tolerance for displaying individual labels on the plot.
           tol = 0.01)

## Add an appropriate title to the PCA plot
pcaPlot <- ggtitle("NMR PCA Plot")

##Display the completed PCA plot
pcaPlot
```

The last thing we need to do is check the quality of the analysis. Scree plots demonstrate how well each principal component (each loading score) represents the data. For example, a PC1 (that's the first principal component) value of 80% means 80% of the data has been accounted for. This would be a much better analysis than a PC1 value of 20%.

To create the scree plot, we can use the following code:

``` {r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
plotScree(pca, style = "trad")
```
