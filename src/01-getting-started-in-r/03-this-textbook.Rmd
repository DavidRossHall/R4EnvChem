# How to Use This Textbook

Before we move onto the actual coding part, let's talk about how to navigate and utilize this textbook.

## Keep in mind

**1. Reading and Active Engagement**

This textbook encourages active learning. Don't merely read through the content---interact with it. Type out the code in your R environment and see the results firsthand. This hands-on approach will solidify your comprehension and enhance your practical skills. Observe how the code behaves, experiment with modifications, and observe how changes impact the outcomes.

**2. Curiosity and Inquisitiveness**

When you encounter code you don't fully understand or want to know the underlying process, lean into your curiosity. Don't hesitate to ask "Why?" and explore concepts beyond the immediate scope. Seek to understand the "why" and "how" alongside the "what."

**3. Resources and Further Explanation**

This textbook is a stepping stone to your R journey. Beyond the content provided, explore the references, suggested readings, and online resources mentioned throughout the chapters. Embrace a curious attitude and continue to expand your knowledge by delving into more advanced topics or specific applications that align with your interests.

**4. Discussion and Collaboration**

If you're using this textbook as part of a class or a group, engage in discussions with your peers. Sharing insights, clarifying doubts, and collaborating on exercises can enhance your learning experience. Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek help, and contribute to a supportive learning environment.

## Useful features

### Searching throughout the textbook

By clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the top left corner, you have the ability to search for keywords across the entire textbook without worrying about case sensitivity. For instance, entering "tidyverse" will display all chapters where tidyverse is mentioned. This gives you a glimpse into future chapters, offering a preview of the various ways you'll be engaging with tidyverse later on!

### How to view the original R Markdown of textbook chapters

This textbook is assembled from individual Rmd files, each representing a chapter. As you progress through the chapters, you may wish to examine the associated Rmd files to delve deeper into the code and its execution.

Simply click on the edit icon in the top left corner to be directed to the corresponding Rmd file on GitHub, opened in a new tab. You're encouraged to download these files, experiment with the code, and observe our Rmd formatting techniques!

## End-of-chapter Exercises

As you progress through each chapter, you'll find `.Rmd` (R Markdown) files available for practice and reinforcement. These Rmd files are designed to provide you with hands-on exercises that align with the concepts covered in the textbook.

Within each Rmd file, you'll encounter straightforward exercises that give you the opportunity to apply what you've learned in each chapter. After completing an exercise, you can run the provided unittest cell to check your answers and receive instant feedback.

Here is an instruction to how to start on the exercises:

1.  Access the Repository:
    - **Recommended for those who have access to UofT JupyterHub**: Click on the following link to automatically clone the "R4EnvChem-Exercises" repository to your UofT JupyterHub:
  [R4EnvChem-Exercises Repository](https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUofTChem-Teaching%2FR4EnvChem-Exercises&urlpath=rstudio%2F). This is a preferred method for anyone completing exercises as part of a UofT course.
    - Alternatively, you can directly download the files from this [repository](https://github.com/UofTChem-Teaching/R4EnvChem-Exercises).

2.  Work on the Exercise:
    - Once inside your JupyterHub's RStudio environment, in the "Files" pane you'll see "R4EnvChem-Exercises" folder (figure below). If you click into this folder, you will see a list of chapter folders. Each chapter folder contains the respective exercise Rmd files. Navigate to the desired chapter's folder and click on the exercise Rmd file you wish to work on. This will open the file in the RStudio editor.

    - Once the Rmd file is open, you can edit, run code chunks, and add your solutions directly in the file. Remember to save your progress regularly. If you want to generate an output document (like a PDF or HTML) to view your results, click on the "Knit" button usually located at the top of the script editor.
    - To enhance readability, you optionally click on the `Visual` tab at the top of the file view and work on the exercises.

**Optional Extra Questions**

For those seeking an additional challenge and a chance to delve into topics beyond the textbook, we offer optional extra questions. Resources and explanations will be provided to support you in tackling these optional questions.

By engaging with these interactive Rmd files, you can actively reinforce your learning, gain practical experience, and explore R concepts in depth. We encourage you to make the most of these resources to enhance your R proficiency. Happy learning!
