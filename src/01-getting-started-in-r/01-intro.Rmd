# (PART\*) Part 1: Getting Started in R {.unnumbered}

# Intro to R and RStudio

You may have heard about coding or the R programming language, but figuring out how to get started can be a hurdle; at least it was for us. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up R and RStudio, both locally on your computer and remotely using the University of Toronto's JupyterHub R Studio server.

## R Language

**R** is the programming language we'll code in. R is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and is one of the most popular programming languages for statisticians and scientist alike due to its vast array of tools and packages.

A quick aside, but don't be intimidated by the term "coding". Coding is simply writing instructions for the computer to execute. The only catch is has to be in a language that both we, humans, and the computer can understand. For our needs we're using R, and like any language, R has it's own syntax, rules, and quirks which we'll cover in later chapters.

## RStudio

**RStudio** is a popular *integrated development environment (IDE)* specifically designed for working with R, providing a user-friendly interface and various productivity features. It's where you'll actually be typing your code and interacting with R. Again, R is a language, and you need somewhere to write it down to make use of it. Writing in English can be done with a pencil and notepad or a word processor filed with useful tools to help you write.

R and RStudio work in tandem to provide an efficient and seamless experience for data analysis, visualization, and model building. RStudio enhances the R workflow with features like code editing, interactive visualization, version control, and package management.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Students learning R have **two options**: working *locally* or *remotely*

*Working locally* involves installing R and RStudio on their computer, providing direct control over data and code without an internet connection. On the other hand, *working remotely* enables access to RStudio through a web browser, avoiding local installations and allowing collaboration. For R programming in chemistry courses at the University of Toronto **we recommend working remotely** using the University of Toronto's JupyterHub so we can ensure a stable R Studio environment where all relevant packages are installed and ready to go. *Working locally* might make sense for independent work as it doesn't require an internet connection. More details on each option are provided below.

### Working Remotely (Recommended for Coursework)

Working remotely means accessing R and RStudio from a remote server or cloud-based platform.

**UofT JupyterHub RStudio server**

To facilitate remote access to RStudio, the University of Toronto provides a JupyterHub R Studio server. This allows you to access RStudio from any web browser, eliminating the need for local installations. With this, you can perform data analysis, collaborate with others, and work on your R projects remotely with ease.

To get started, visit [UofT JupyterHub](https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca/). You will need to log in with your UofT credentials to access the RStudio environment.

-   While working remotely, you may need to upload data to the RStudio server or download analysis results. The RStudio interface allows you to upload files directly from your computer to the server and vice versa.
-   When working remotely, ensure that you save your R scripts and analysis files on the server. This will allow you to continue your work from any device with internet access.
-   Most R packages are pre-installed on the University of Toronto's R Studio server. However, if you require additional packages, we will soon learn how to install packages.

Remember that while working remotely, a stable internet connection is essential to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted experience. Additionally, always remember to save your work and log out properly after each session to maintain the security of your data. Happy coding!

### Working Locally

When you work locally, you need to install both R and RStudio on your personal computer or a machine that you physically have access to.

#### Downloading R and RStudio

You can download the latest build of **R** for your operating system [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

You can download the latest version of **RStudio** [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Once you have both R and RStudio downloaded, go ahead and open up RStudio.

## Using RStudio

When you open your RStudio (either locally or remotely), you'll be greeted with an interface divided into numerous panes. We've highlighted the major ones in the image below:

![The RStudio interface with annottated regions](images/Rstudio_startup_regions.png){width="100%"}

Each pane serves a specific role:

-   **The console** allows you to directly type and run your code. It also provides messages, warnings, and errors from any code you run.
-   **The environment** window lists all variables, data, and functions you've created since the start of your coding session.\
-   **The viewer** shows your outputs, help documents, etc. which each has their own tab.

## Running R Code

Y2 + 2ou can run bits of R code directly from the console. Throughout the book, code you can copy and run will look like this:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

Notice that both the code (the first part) and what the code outputs (the second part) are shown. Throughout this book code outputs will be preceded by `##`. You can run code directly from the console. It's handy for short and sweet snippets of code, something that can be typed in a single line. Examples of this is the `install.packages()` function, or to use R as a calculator:

```{r}
2 * 3
```

```{r}
pi * (10/2)
```

However, working like this isn't very useful. Imagine printing a book one sentence at a time, you couldn't really go back and edit earlier work because it's already printed. That's why we write out code in *scripts*. *Scripts* are similar to recipes, in that they're a series of instructions that R evaluates from the top of the script to the bottom. More importantly, writing your code out in a script makes it *more readable* to humans (presumably this includes you). Don't undervalue the usefulness of legible code. Your code will execute in seconds or minutes but it might take you hours to understand what it does.

Let's open up a new script in RStudio by going to *File*-\>*New File*-\>*R Script*, or by clicking on the highlighted button in the image below.

![](images/Rstudio_newscript.png){width="100%"}

This should open up a new window in the RStudio interface, as shown in the following image.

![](images/Rstudio_scriptwindow.png){width="100%"}

You can copy and paste the code above into the script, save it, edit it, etc. and ultimately run specific lines of code by highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac), or by clicking the "Run" button in the top right corner of the Scripts window. You can copy an entire block of code using the `copy` button in the top right corner of the code block. In this way, this research is a tool to learn R coding and also a repository for code that you can copy and use.

We'll dive into the basics of coding in R in the next chapter.

## Customizing RStudio

As many of us spend an absurd amount of time staring at bright screens, some of you may be interested in setting your RStudio to Dark Mode.

You can customize the appearance of your RStudio interface by clicking *Tools*-\>*Global Options*, or *RStudio*-\>*Preferences* on Mac, then clicking "Appearance" on the left. Select your preferred Editor Theme from the list.

## Where to get help

Given the popularity of R if you've run into an issue it's very likely that someone else has too and they've complained about it and someone else has almost certainly solved it! An often unappreciated aspect of coding/data science is knowing *how* to get help, *how* to search for it, and *how* to translate someone's solutions to your unique situation.

Places to get help include:

-   Google, Stack Overflow, etc. When in doubt Google it.
-   Using built-in documentation (`?help`)
-   Reference books such as the invaluable [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), which inspired this entire project.
-   Ask for help, from TAs or Profs if using this webbook as a resource for a class, or from colleagues or peers .

## Summary

In this chapter we've covered:

-   How to use RStudio to do R programming, both remotely and locally
-   The benefits of working remotely using platforms like the University of Torontoâ€™s JupyterHub RStudio server.
-   Resources for help when you get stuck, including Google, Stack Overflow, and reference books.


In the next chapter we'll break down how to setup your work in R for legibility, simplicity, and reproducibility. After all, the person cursing any of your sloppy work will invariably be you, so be kind to yourself, and do it right the first time.

## Exercise

Now that you've learned the basics of setting up and customizing R and RStudio, let's put some of that knowledge into practice.

### Setup

-   Access UofT JupyterHub RStudio server [here](https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca/).
-   (Optional) Change your RStudio appearance as you like.

### Basic R Commands

-   In the `Console` tab, write an expression to calculate 10 plus 5 and press `enter`.
-   Open a new R script and type in the following commands:

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- x + y
print(z)
```

(In the future, we will work with an R markdown instead of an R script, which we will explain more in the following chapters.)

-   Run the script. What is the output?

### Using the Help Function

-   Let's say you've come across a function in R that you don't know how to use, for example, `sqrt()`. Use the `?` command to access the documentation for this function from your console tab.
-   What does the `sqrt()` function do?

### Reflection

-   What are your first impressions of RStudio as an IDE? Do you have any prior experience with other programming languages or IDEs? If so, how does RStudio compare?
