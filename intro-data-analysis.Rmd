# (PART\*) Section 2: Data Wrangling in R {-}

# Intro to Data Wrangling

This section will teach you **how** to use R to import and organize your data as part of a cohesive data analysis workflow. Whether it takes 10 minutes or 10 hrs, *you'll use this workflow for every data analysis project*. By explicitly understanding the workflow steps, and how to execute them in R, you'll be more than capable of expanding the limited tools learned from this book to any number of data analysis projects you'll soon encounter.

The explicit workflow we'll be teaching was originally described by Wickham and Grolemund, and consists of six key steps:

- **Import** is the first step and consist of getting your data into R. Seems obvious, but doing it correctly will save you time and headaches down the line. 
- **Tidy** refers to organizing your data in a *tidy* manner where each variable is a column, and each observation a row. This is often the least intuitive part about working with R, especially if you've only used Excel, but it's critical. If you don't tidy your data, you'll be fighting it every step of the way.
- **Transform** is anything you do to your data including any mathematical operations or narrowing in on a set of observations. It's often the first stage of the cycle as you'll need to transform your data in some manner to obtain a desired plot.
- **Visualize** is any of the plots/graphics you'll generate with R. Take advantage of R and plot often, it's the easiest way to spot an errors. 
- **Model** is an extension of mathematical operations to help understand your data. The *linear regressions* needed for a calibration curve are an example of a model. 
- **Communicate** is the final step and is where you share the *knowledge* you've squeezed out of the information in the original data. 

*Import*, *Tidy*, and *Transformation* go hand-in-hand in a process called *wrangling*. Wrangling is all of the steps needed to get your data ready for analysis. It's often the most tedious and frustrating, hence wrangling (it's a fight...), but once done make the subsequent cycle of understanding your data via *transformation*, *visualizations*, and *modelling* much easier and more predictable. 

In this section we'll cover data wrangling before moving onto the next section where we'll explore data analysis as it pertains to environmental chemistry. 

## Example Data

Throughout this section and the next we'll be making use of a couple of example datasets. These datasets are all availabe in the `data` subfolder of the *R4EnvChem Project Template*. If you haven't already, you can download them from the repo [here](https://github.com/DavidRossHall/R4EnvChem-ProjectTemplate)

## Further Reading

In case it hasn't been apparent enough, this entire endeavour was inspired by the *R for Data Science* reference book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Every step described above is explored in more detail in their book, which can be read freely online at [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). We strongly encourage you to read through the book to supplement your R data analysis skills.
